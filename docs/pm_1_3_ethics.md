## Complaint Process

2. Staff determines whether complaint meets the formal requirements of the **Rules of Procedure**
3. The complaint is reviewed by the Council chairperson who

      2. filing is delayed beyond one year without good cause
      3. matter will not result in ethical violation even if proven true
         1. analogous to 'motion to dismiss' in standard legal proceedings
   2. defers
      1. parties are involved in litigation, arbitration, or another dispute resolution process.
   3. case can proceed
4. Council forwards case to respondent for response
   1. Case will proceed even if no response is submitted
   2. Council will still send notices even if respondent is uncommunicative.
5. Unless information is received from the respondent supports dismissal or deferral the chairperson assigns the case to one of the other Council members who serves as the **hearing officer**
6. The hearing officer reviews the complaint, response, and documentation to confirm the case should proceed
   1. Dismissal or deferral must be agreed upon with chairperson
7. Pre-hearing conference is conducted
   1. set date for hearing and location
8. Hearing is conducted as in-person meeting
9. Hearing officer prepares **Report and Recommendation**
10. Report and Recommendation is sent to both parties for written comment
11. **case record** is submitted to the members of the Council for review
12. In a subsequent Council meeting the hearing officer makes introductory remarks and responds to questions
    1. If either party requested to appear before the Council they may make short statements and respond to questions
13. Council deliberates and determines decision by **majority vote**
14. Written decision is issued to parties

### The hearing officer

similar to an arbitrator
not the decision maker but runs the process during the pre-hearing and hearing phases.

### Pre-haring conference

typically conducted by phone

references possibility of settlement

each party's counsel or advisors are permitted to participate in the call

call is not transcribed or recorded and is not entered into the case record

### The Hearing

in-person with:

- hearing officer
- complainant
- respondent
- counsel and designated advisers
- witnesses during their testimony
- court reporter retained by the AIA

often lasts one day

no evidence is permitted beyond what was indicated by the parties in the pre-hearing

typical agenda:

1. brief opening statements by both parties
2. presentation of the complainant's evidence
3. presentation of the respondent's evidence
4. closing statements

Witness testimony is followed by an opportunity for the opposing party to ask questions.

The hearing officer will often ask the witness questions to complete the record

The complaint, response, and supporting documentary evidence submitted are marked for inclusion in the case record.

### Report and Recommendation

written document describing the case

- cites the Rules of Conduct from Code of Ethics that were allegedly violated
- presents facts
- states hearing officer's conclusions
- if a violation is found recommends a penalty

Report and Recommendation is distributed to parties to submit written comments.

### The case record

includes

- Report and Recommendation
- reporter's transcript of the hearing
- hearing exhibits
- written comments

### Penalties

Penalties are set by the AIA's bylaws.

National Ethics Council has no authority to require a respondent to pay money, take any action, or refrain from any conduct.

Unintended or minor infractions result in a non public _admonishment_

More significant violations are made public

1. censure of respondent by publication of a notice in an Institute periodical.
2. Membership in Institute may be suspended for a period of time (1-3 years)
3. Membership can be terminated

In all instances the respondent's AIA membership record will reflect the penalty.

### Appeals

Members in violation may choose to appeal the decision.

In an appeal both parties are given an opportunity to submit statements to the Executive Committee.

Matters resulting in termination are automatically considered as an appeal.

### Common Complaints

- Attribution of Credit
- Homeowner complaints
